 * ## Using BuildURLMixin
 * To use url building, include the mixin when extending an adapter, and call `buildURL` where needed.
 * The default behaviour is designed for RESTAdapter.
 * ### Example
 * ```javascript
 * export default DS.Adapter.extend(BuildURLMixin, {
 * findRecord: function(store, type, id, snapshot) {
 * var url = this.buildURL(type.modelName, id, snapshot, 'findRecord');
 * return this.ajax(url, 'GET');
 * }
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Attributes
 * The `host` and `namespace` attributes will be used if defined, and are optional.
